          Online is already becoming the most preferred place to feature goods
          and services and experts had estimated that by the year 2040, 95% of
          purchases will be through e-commerce platforms. Currently, traditional
          brick and mortar stores have more off-line presence in rural and urban
          areas compared with their online presence. Turung is designed to
          provide free online stores to enable off-line stores to sell their
          products or services beyond their physical location and local
          currency.

              Turung is an online smartstore that allows traditional brick and
              mortar businesses to process crypto-fiat liquidity through a
              decentralized payment system called TURUpay. With this payment
              system, imagine cashing out your Shiba Inu straight into fiat
              (either as cash or through your bank account) at a local store
              with one-time transaction fees. This will revolutionize how brick
              and mortar stores operate by giving access to the $3trillion
              Crypto market.

              TURUpay is an enterprise protocol that allows users to cash out
              crypto into fiat currency or pay for products/services using
              cryptos while the seller has the alternative to receive either
              fiat or any currency kind of choice (as payment), with this
              possibility, Turung smartstore is designed to become one of the
              world's largest crypto-fiat liquidity providing platforms in the
              blockchain space. However, through the global network of Turung
              smartstore, Turupay allows third-party platforms to be accessed by
              over a 300million crypto users worldwide and over 18,000
              businesses through its P2P liquidity option with a single
              transaction fee, thus making it fast and convenient for payments.
              TURUpay is powered by Turupower tokens (TPR) which power every
              currency conversion and transaction within the Turung ecosystem.
