        Online is already becoming the most preferred place to feature goods and
        services and experts had estimated that by the year 2040, 95% of
        purchases will be through e-commerce platforms. Currently, traditional
        brick and mortar stores have more off-line presence in rural and urban
        areas compared with their online presence. Turung is designed to provide
        free online stores to enable off-line stores to sell their products or
        services beyond their physical location and local currency.
